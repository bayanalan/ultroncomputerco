# About This Website

Hi everybody, I made a website for my "company" Ultron Computer Co. You can use this website for a template when you are making your own website.

# What this project uses

kepp in mind that this project uses the easier version of CSS called Tailwind CSS. This project also uses Daisy UI for Tailwind CSS. With daisy, you can select different themes like "cupcake" or "fantasy". For this project I used the theme "wireframe" whick makes the text look like what it whould look like in balsamiq mockups.
