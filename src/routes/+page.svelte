 <h1 class="text-center text-6xl pt-12">About Me</h1> 
<p class="text-center pt-10" > My name is Bayan Jones and I am nine years old. Ultron Computer Co is my own Computer Company. I really like making computers, and that's
 why I started the Ultron Computer Co.</p>
 <h1 class="text-6xl text-center font-Roboto pt-14">UltronBook</h1>
 <h1 class="pt-5 text-center">The UltronBook is a Laptop which I designed in tinkercad. It has a 13 inch display,
runs android 12 Samsung DeX, 8gb RAM, 5 megapixel camera, 128GB Built in storage, 3 fans, and a 1TB Micro SD Card. I have the Galaxy S10, the display, and the trackpad. I apologize if the Micro SD Card was $184.25 </h1>

<h1 class="text-center text-6xl pt-14">EZELEA</h1>

<h1 class="text-center pt-5">You might be thinking that I am crazy for naming the next big thing after a company that makes showerheads, but I make some computers out of boxes. The EZELEA showerhead box has a magnetic lid to open it. 1: I thought the lid was good for upgrading storage, 2: I didn't want to hot glue paper to the top of the computer to put an Ultron logo on it and call it the GameBox 2. I did hot glue paper to the bottom which actually looks pretty good. The EZELEA will be a retro gaming device smaller that a Xbox Series X! I already have the Raspberry Pi 4 8GB and the 256GB Micro SD Card. </h1>

<h1 class="text-center text-6xl pt-14">Dream PC</h1>

<h1 class="text-center pt-5">I included my Dream PC because I want to develop websites with code, (you need a powerful computer to do that), play games and make videos about it, (you also need a powerful computer to do that), and I want to use it for tinkercad models of Ultron computers. I already have the Aorus B450 Pro Motherboard</h1>
