 <h1 class="text-6xl text-center font-Roboto pt-14">UltronBook</h1>
 <h1 class="pt-5 text-center">The UltronBook is a Laptop which I designed in tinkercad. It has a 13 inch display,
runs android 13 Samsung DeX, 8gb RAM, 5 megapixel camera, 128GB Built in storage, 3 fans, 8 usb ports, USB-C charging, a 3.5mm jack, and a 1TB Micro SD Card. Currently, I have the display, and the trackpad. I apologize if the Micro SD Card was $184.25 </h1>

<h1 class=" poppins text-center text-6xl pt-14">PlayBox 2</h1>

<h1 class="text-center pt-5">The PlayBox 2 is a gaming console almost as fast as a PS5. it is very simple, just a Galaxy S10+ with a USB C dock. it is very fast with one HDMI, one USB 3rd gen port, one USB 2nd gen port and one multi-use USB C port. It also has force landscape and console launcher.</h1>

<h1 class=" poppins text-center text-6xl pt-14">PlayCube</h1>

<h1 class="text-center pt-5">Yes the PlayBox is amazing, but there was a keyboard problem. It was based on the Galaxy S10 android, which means you have to get up to type on a phone screen, and when you have a cold (I dont) you cant relax and play a video game. So I found a better controller! A keyboard with a trackpad! It has much better menu navigation and is much easier to use.</h1>

<h1 class="text-center text-6xl pt-14">Dream PC</h1>

<h1 class="text-center pt-5">I included my Dream PC because I want to develop websites with code, (you need a powerful computer to do that), play games and make videos about it, (you also need a powerful computer to do that), and I want to use it for tinkercad models of Ultron computers. I already have the Aorus B450 Pro Motherboard</h1>

<h1 class="text-center text-6xl pt-14 ">Ultron Desktop </h1>

<h1 class="text-center pt-5">This is what you can call the UltronBook with a 24 inch display without the bottom part and without the hinge, although the real name is the Ultron Desktop. The way it is going to be made is by taking an old cracked Galaxy S10+ with DeX and putting it in a 3D-Printed desktop frame. It has 4 usb ports, USB-C charging, and a disc drive.</h1>
